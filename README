This is a change conducted in the Foo Feature branch How cool is this git program/feature?


This is the first Git project I have successfully created ;by going through the treehouse tutorial.
Might be a good idea to add a few things that I've learn't (and that I can remember) in this file for me to revert back to later.

This file is intended to help Treehouse students learn how to use git repositoriesx

git init - intitiate a particular git directory ie "git init my_first_repository" will create a new repository called my_first_repository.
rm - this is used to remove a file
ls - details all the files in a particular directory
cd - change directory, either to the home directory or to a documents directory (if it exists) "cd documents"

git commit - This is used to commit changes to the repository.
git commit -a -m "message here" - This is how you shortcut the commit process by adding the commit message to you commit.
git branch - this will bring up a list of all the git branches associated with your project/repository
git checkout - this is used to change from one branch to another
git checkout master - this gets you back onto the master or "trunk" branch of your project.
