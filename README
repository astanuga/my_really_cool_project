This is the first Git project I have successfully created ;by going through the treehouse tutorial.
Might be a good idea to add a few things that I've learn't (and that I can remember) in this file for me to revert back to later.

This file is intended to help Treehouse students learn how to use git repositoriesx

git init - intitiate a particular git directory ie "git init my_first_repository" will create a new repository called my_first_repository.
rm - this is used to remove a file
ls - details all the files in a particular directory
cd - change directory, either to the home directory or to a documents directory (if it exists) "cd documents"
